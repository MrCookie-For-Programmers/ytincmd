ASCII Video Player üé¨üëæ
This Python script is a wild little creation that plays YouTube videos directly in your console as glorious ASCII art. It even attempts to sync the audio, turning your terminal into a retro-futuristic multimedia experience. It's like watching a movie on a super-low-fi, interdimensional screen.

Features
Plays YouTube videos as ASCII art in the console.

Downloads and plays the audio in a separate thread for (mostly) synchronized playback.

Clears the screen for a smooth, flipbook-like effect.

Prerequisites
You'll need Python 3 installed on your system. The script also relies on several libraries and system commands.

Installation
Linux üêß
For Linux, it's best to use a virtual environment to keep things tidy. We'll also grab some system dependencies.

First, make sure you have pip, venv, and alsa-utils installed.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv alsa-utils

The alsa-utils package provides the aplay command for audio playback.

Create and activate a virtual environment.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install the required Python packages using pip.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Windows üíª
For Windows, you can install the dependencies directly with pip. Note that the audio playback functionality, which uses the aplay command, is designed for Linux. You would need to modify the script to work with a different audio player on Windows.

Install the required Python packages. It's recommended to use py to ensure you're using Python 3.

py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

macOS üçé
Similar to Windows, the aplay command for audio will not work out of the box on macOS. The script would need to be edited to use a macOS-compatible command like afplay.

Install the required Python packages.

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Once you've installed the prerequisites, just run the script from your terminal:

Make sure you are in the correct directory.

If you're on Linux and used a virtual environment, activate it: source venv/bin/activate

Run the script:

python3 lol.py

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a YouTube video URL.
